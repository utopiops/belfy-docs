# Introduction

Belfy is a tool for generating CRUD applications from your data definitions. You can also customize the applications in a declarative fashion using YAML files. 
With Belfy, you can build full-stack or split-stack applications. Built with modularity at its core, Belfy promotes an ecosystem of extensions to support more frameworks and technologies.


## Getting Started

To create a CRUD application follow these steps:

1. Place all your data definition and customization files (entities.yaml, navbar.yaml, page_overrides.yaml) in a specific folder
2. Run the following command in your terminal:
   
```bash
npx belfy create
```
3. Answer the questions based on your preferences. (You'll also be asked about the path of the folder specified in step 1)
